# CityBuilderPractice
EngoEngine has a city builder tutorial. It is incomplete and hasn't been updated since Feb 2021. Trying to finish the incomplete(and most difficult) parts. 

Begining can be found here https://github.com/EngoEngine/TrafficManager/tree/01-hello-world

I have changed multiple parts for better code reusability. I have added an updated UI, new money system, created roads to be built between cities, new message systems, changed mouse functions, and more.

I am currently(or may have finished at time of reading) adding path seeking for roads built. Roads connecting multiple towns will upgrade to cities, to metros, ect.

Next I will be adding audio, traffic managment, and traffic visuals. 

To run game, clone the repository, and in terminal run:

$go mod tidy

$go mod run .
